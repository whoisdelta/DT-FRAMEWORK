# DT-FRAMEWORK V0.1

A lightweight FiveM roleplay framework built with Lua that provides essential server functionality including user management, staff systems, vehicle spawning, and basic economy features. A very good base for you to start from, as a beginner.

This is the V0.1 that means the framework contains just the essentials for starting from it. More things will be added soon...

If you find a bug or wanna ask something add me on discord @whoisdelta. or discord.gg/dtstore (discord.gg/qZFsns5ZjS)

Btw, the database tables are creating themself so dont worry about'em.
